						<h3>Females in Mass Spectrometry (FeMS)</h3>
						<p>Workshop Organizers<br/> Si Wu, University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma, United States<br/> Hui Ye, China Pharmaceutical University, Jiangsu China <br/><br/>Females in Mass Spectrometry (FeMS) is a community-led initiative to create a network of support for women in the field of mass spectrometry. The aim of the FeMS workshop at the 1st CASMS virtual conference is to celebrate and support Chinese female scientists in the MS field. Five well-established female leaders in the community will tell us about their journey up to this point. We also assemble a great group of panelists ready to discuss and share their experience/challenges as female scientists. The interactive Q&A session will give the audience a great opportunity to virtually meet our speakers and panelists and ask the questions. The FeMS workshop has been successfully held on Thursday (August 12) 10:00 AM - 11:00 AM (Ballroom 1) in GatherTown.</p>
